Can I *really* start aiSound models in the future?

Can all sounds depend on getting a baseSound stop() (which disconnects?) [no matter how sounds end of quitting?]


All sounds should manage play() while playing, even if it just stops and starts (don't ignore)
	If they ignore shen ifpalyingP===true, then if something goes wrong prevents a stop(), they'll neverrrrrrrr be able to play again.


Push all sounds to the limit with tickTiming.FUN


Check that phasor works for restarts (from phase 0), pausing, etc.
We get a stutter on restarts and even the first time it plays right now.


Still losing some sounds when we "replace" reandomly - probably not getting stops, and then never playing agin. 


combine aiSlider from stretched harmonics and aisound


Make gain non linear.
